      <h1>The Other America</h1>
      <p>On April 14, 1967 Dr.King Delivered his “Other America” speech at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. The speech points to a huge issue in America that is still present today and that is the poverty gap. He mentions one America that is affluent, growing, and full of opportunities, while the other consists of poverty, unemployment, and feeling of inferiority. This speech points out that only one America is truly living with “liberty and justice for all” while the other is not. Mentioning more specifically that the impoverished America is one consisting of different ethnic backgrounds with the most prominent in regards to population being African Americans. This audience was methodically chosen by Dr.King while many students that are privileged enough to attend Stanford University are members of affluent America.
