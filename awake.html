      <h1>Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution</h1>
      <p>MLKs “Remaining Awake through a Great Revolution” speech was delivered at the National Cathedral, Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1968. While speaking to a predominantly white audience MLK seeks to bring Americans together through patriotism and religion. MLK makes several allusions to the bible, and also delivers a call to action by challenging Americans to abide by principles that built the nation. Dr.King mentions the “destiny” that is to be had in America and how the country can preach liberties such as freedom and equality, but still continue unjust practices. This speech was methodically written to appeal to moderate white Americans by alluding to religion and also forcing them to think about how great of a nation America could be if their actions were true to their guiding principles. Effectively using a method of encouraging America rather than criticizing.</p>
