      <h1>I Have a Dream Speech</h1>
      <p>In elementary school we were introduced to basic arithmetic, the seven continents, and Dr.Kings “I Have a Dream” speech. Without a doubt MLKs most famous and most well known piece of work. On August 28, 1963 Dr.King stood in front of a crowd of nearly 250,000 people at the National Mall in Washington D.C. and delivered this monumental speech. Advocating for civil rights, he emphasizes that he has faith in America, even using words stated by the Founding Fathers saying “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal”. He states this and points out the injustice in the nation, successfully exposing the hypocrisy and unconstitutionality of segregation. </p>
