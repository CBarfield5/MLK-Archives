      <h1>Letter From Birmingham Jail</h1>
      <p>After Dr.King and several of his associates were arrested while peacefully protesting segregation in Birmingham, Alabama he wrote a <a href="#">letter</a> from his jail cell. Many people attribute the Civil Rights Act of 1964, passed by congress, to be heavily influenced by this letter. Dr.King was motivated by a statement made in the newspaper by eight clergymen which encouraged the protester to wait and settle this in court, rather than creating the tension which the protests organized by MLK created. He encourages the people in this letter to continue the fight for civil rights, no matter the circumstances. This letter is a demonstration of not only how good of a public speaker MLK is, but also how masterful of a writer he was. His words were so powerful he was able to thousands with a piece of paper and ink while sitting in a concrete jail cell.</p>
