      <h1>Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break the Silence</h1>
      <p>Dr.Kings “Beyond Vietnam” speech given at Riverside Church was one of his most controversial. Given a year to the day before his death, this speech was a landmark moment for MLK because of his criticism of not only the U.S. domestically but also internationally. Showing his support for nonviolence internationally, not only in the context of the Civil Rights Movement. One of his key statements is MLK being critical of the United States motivation of being engaged in violent foreign affairs, but failing to spotlight and tend to its own domestic flaws. The controversialness of this speech comes with MLK showing his support to end the vietnam war. While some found his speech “unpatriotic”, this showed the Dr.King was not just confined to the boundaries of the United States, but furthermore to the impact the nation has on the entire world.
